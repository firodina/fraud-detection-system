🛡️ Fraud Detection System with Explainable Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques while addressing the challenges of highly imbalanced data. In addition to building accurate models, the project emphasizes model explainability using SHAP to ensure transparency and actionable business insights.

The work is structured into three main tasks:

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

Model Building & Evaluation

Model Explainability & Business Recommendations
